# Demos

## Simple netcat reverse shell
![revshell](simple.gif?raw=true)

## Hide process & CPU usage
##### CPU usage is handled automatically if the process is hidden.
![cpu](cpu.gif?raw=true)
> Pro-tip: don't use 100% of all available CPU's at the same time

## Log tty keys and steal passwords over SSH (and FTP)
![keylog](tty.gif?raw=true)
> Gotcha: mistyped and copy & paste keys will not be logged

## Extract base address of a running process
![vm->start](base_address.gif?raw=true)

## Simple persistence using ELF infection with Volundr
##### Persist rootkit between reboots with the help of [Volundr](https://github.com/carloslack/volundr)
##### md5sum output for the modified ELF is automatically hijacked by KoviD
![elf](persist.gif?raw=true)
> KoviD must be running at the time install.sh is called so the new md5sum output can be applied to the new modified ELF.
> This is very specific for `md5sum` tool only and `md5sum -c` is not handled.

## Hide pre-defined network application
##### Network Application names are defined in `netapp.h` and must follow what is stored in fnode->filename. For example, in Ubuntu `nc` is actually `nc.traditional` : `/usr/bin/nc -> /etc/alternatives/nc -> /bin/nc.traditional`
![netapp](netapp.gif?raw=true)
> Both process and connection are hidden, as shown in the animation above.
> Because it is a `Network Application` if the module is removed the process is killed
> in order to not leave traces behind
> `netapp.h` executable names are dummy and there just as examples and should be changed to match actual NetApp tools
> one will use.

## Trying some anti-rk's that are available out there
##### bpf-hookdetect
![BPF](bpf.gif?raw=true)
> [bpf-hookdetect](https://github.com/pathtofile/bpf-hookdetect) possible false positives for sys_getdents - KoviD does not hook sys_getdents family.
> BPF tools will fail if attempting to read from syscall stack traces. KoviD clears the stack trace and will force an error.
> So if the application ignores the error code it will then not be able to read the stack.
##### rkspotter
![BPF](anti01.gif?raw=true)
> [rkspotter](https://github.com/linuxthor/rkspotter) apparently it would work against some popular rootkits, but not against us (at least for now)
##### rkbreaker
![BPF](anti02.gif?raw=true)
> [rkbreaker](https://github.com/linuxthor/rkbreaker) it is supposed to block some rootkit from being loaded and, if loaded, break some functionalities
> on some `known` rootkits (not KoviD, KoviD is not `known`) but anyway, don't break anything for us

## Stealth mode run
![stealth](stealth.gif?raw=true)
> `DEPLOY=1` indicates stealth mode build
> `cat /proc/kovid` returns the `password` to reveal the rootkit.
> Note: `/proc/kovid` has, by default, 120 seconds of timeout that once expired will hide the proc interface that cannot be used until `kill -SIGCONT 31337` is used to toggle it back
